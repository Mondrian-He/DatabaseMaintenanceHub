- 😁[DatabaseMaintenanceHub/DBA_backup_restore at main · Mondrian-He/DatabaseMaintenanceHub (github.com)](https://github.com/Mondrian-He/DatabaseMaintenanceHub/tree/main/DBA_backup_restore)——This section focuses on strategies, tools, and best practices for database backup and restoration. The goal is to compare and evaluate the differences and challenges in the backup and restoration processes between handling plaintext and encrypted (cryptographic) databases.
- 😁[DatabaseMaintenanceHub/DBA_grant at main · Mondrian-He/DatabaseMaintenanceHub (github.com)](https://github.com/Mondrian-He/DatabaseMaintenanceHub/tree/main/DBA_grant)——This part discusses database authorization management, including permission allocation, role management, and security policies. By analyzing the authorization mechanisms of plaintext and encrypted databases, we can understand the balance between management complexity and security.
- 😁[DatabaseMaintenanceHub/DBA_performance_monitoring at main · Mondrian-He/DatabaseMaintenanceHub (github.com)](https://github.com/Mondrian-He/DatabaseMaintenanceHub/tree/main/DBA_performance_monitoring)——This section involves database performance monitoring and tuning techniques. It includes assessing the special requirements and challenges of encrypted databases in performance monitoring and tuning, as well as comparative analysis with plaintext databases.
- 🤩[DatabaseMaintenanceHub/DBA_transaction_concurrency at main · Mondrian-He/DatabaseMaintenanceHub (github.com)](https://github.com/Mondrian-He/DatabaseMaintenanceHub/tree/main/DBA_transaction_concurrency)——This section involves database transaction management and concurrency control strategies, focusing on the application and challenges of locking mechanisms.
- 😶‍🌫️[DatabaseMaintenanceHub/DBA_revoke at main · Mondrian-He/DatabaseMaintenanceHub (github.com)](https://github.com/Mondrian-He/DatabaseMaintenanceHub/tree/main/DBA_revoke)——This section dives into the specifics of managing and revoking database access in encrypted database environments. It focuses on the nuanced differences between revoking access in plaintext versus encrypted databases, highlighting best practices and strategies to ensure data security without compromising efficiency. Through detailed discussions and examples, we aim to provide DBAs with the knowledge needed to effectively manage user permissions and access controls in the context of encrypted data storage.
- 🫥[DatabaseMaintenanceHub/DBA_recovery at main · Mondrian-He/DatabaseMaintenanceHub (github.com)](https://github.com/Mondrian-He/DatabaseMaintenanceHub/tree/main/DBA_recovery)——Focusing on disaster recovery in the realm of encrypted databases, particularly with scenarios like power failures, this section outlines recovery strategies, tools, and protocols designed to safeguard data integrity and availability. It contrasts the challenges and solutions for recovery in encrypted databases against those in plaintext databases, providing insights into the complexities and considerations unique to encrypted data recovery. DBAs will find valuable resources and guides to prepare for, respond to, and recover from unexpected data disruptions, ensuring minimal impact on business continuity.
- 🥱[DatabaseMaintenanceHub/DBA_QueryPlanAnalysis at main · Mondrian-He/DatabaseMaintenanceHub (github.com)](https://github.com/Mondrian-He/DatabaseMaintenanceHub/tree/main/DBA_QueryPlanAnalysis)——This part offers a deep dive into the analysis of query execution plans within encrypted databases. It explores the additional layers of complexity introduced by encryption, from performance implications to the optimization of query execution. Comparative studies with plaintext databases shed light on the nuances of tuning and monitoring in an encrypted environment. This section aims to equip DBAs with advanced techniques and insights for optimizing database performance while ensuring the security of sensitive data through encryption.
- 😫[DatabaseMaintenanceHub/DBA_extra at main · Mondrian-He/DatabaseMaintenanceHub (github.com)](https://github.com/Mondrian-He/DatabaseMaintenanceHub/tree/main/DBA_extra)——A compilation of supplementary questions, advanced topics, and miscellaneous insights related to database administration in encrypted environments.
